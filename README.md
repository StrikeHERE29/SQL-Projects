# SQL Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Projects collection! Here, you'll find a variety of SQL-based challenges and analyses that I’ve worked on, where I explore data and solve problems using SQL.

This repository is my journey into SQL, where I’ve focused on learning and refining my skills through hands-on projects. Whether it's simple queries or more complex data manipulations, each project showcases how I approach and solve data problems using SQL.

## What’s inside?
- **Basic Queries**: Simple tasks like filtering, sorting, and selecting data.
- **Advanced SQL**: Complex queries with joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Real-World Problems**: Projects that solve real business challenges using data.

## Why did I create this?
SQL is such a powerful tool for unlocking insights from data, and this repository is my way of documenting my progress. Each project represents a milestone in my learning journey, and I'm constantly adding new challenges to improve my skills.

## What can you expect from this repo?
- Well-structured SQL queries
- Solutions to common data analysis problems
- Clear explanations of what each project is about
- Insights gained from real-world datasets

I hope you find these projects useful, whether you’re just starting with SQL or looking for inspiration. If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to reach out – I’m always open to learning from others!
