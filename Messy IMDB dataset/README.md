Messy IMDB Dataset Cleaning Project
This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a messy IMDB dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The goal was to turn raw data into a clean and usable format for further analysis.

Key Steps Taken:
Handling Missing Values

Removed all NULL values and empty fields from the dataset.
Removing Duplicates

Identified and removed duplicate rows based on titleID and other relevant columns.
Cleaning Data Formats

Fixed extra spaces, special characters, and common errors in fields like Release Year, Country, Income, etc.
Standardizing Data Formats

Ensured consistency in date formats, genres, and years, using a uniform DD-MM-YYYY format.
Correcting Data Types

Converted columns like Duration, Votes, and Income to the appropriate data types (INT, FLOAT).
Removing Irrelevant Columns

Dropped the empty column Column 8, which served no purpose.
Final Outcome:
The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for more advanced analysis or visualization projects. ðŸŽ‰
